# Tetris

This is a simple Tetris game implemented in Python using the `pygame` library.

The second file is a browser-based HTML Tetris game that runs without any installation.

## Installation for PyGame

Before running the Python game you must install `pygame`.

```bash
py -m pip install pygame
```

Alternatively use `python3 -m pip install pygame` if the `py` launcher is not available.

## Running the Game

From the project directory execute:

```bash
py Tetris.py
```

This will open a window with the Tetris start menu. Use the arrow keys to navigate and press `Enter` to start.

## Controls

- `Left` / `Right` – Move the piece horizontally
- `Down` – Soft drop (faster fall)
- `A` – Rotate piece clockwise
- `D` – Rotate piece counter-clockwise
- `Q` – Quit to main menu

Enjoy!
